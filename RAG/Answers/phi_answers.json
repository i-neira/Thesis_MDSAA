        "answer": "Welcome to Lisbon! Arriving as an international student can be both exciting and a bit overwhelming, but don’t worry—I’m here to help guide you through the first few important steps.\n\n1. **Register Your Residence**: As soon as you arrive, you’ll need to register your residence with local authorities. If you're from the EU or EEA, you'll apply for an European Union citizen registration certificate in Lisbon. This process typically involves visiting the local council office. It's a crucial step, so make sure to gather all necessary documents before heading there.\n\n2. **Apply for Your Portuguese Student VISA**: If you haven't already obtained your visa before arrival (which I highly recommend doing as soon as possible), be prepared to follow up on any requirements that might have been pending. Visa issues can take time, so getting this sorted early helps avoid unnecessary stress.\n\n3. **Set Up a Bank Account**: Opening a local bank account will make it easier to manage your finances, pay tuition fees, and handle everyday expenses. Most banks in Lisbon are welcoming to international students and offer accounts specifically for them.\n\n4. **Secure Housing**: If you haven’t found permanent accommodation yet, explore short-term options like hotels or hostels until you secure a longer-term rental. For rentals, it’s helpful to know that the average rent can vary significantly depending on your location and preferences in Lisbon.\n\n5. **Transportation**: Getting around Lisbon is easy with its excellent public transport system. Consider purchasing a Navegante card for monthly travel passes if you plan on using buses or trams frequently.\n\n6. **Explore Your New City**: Take some time to explore the neighborhoods around NOVA IMS, find local shops and markets, and maybe even join some student groups or activities that can help you settle in and make new friends.\n\nRemember, moving abroad is a big adventure!

        "answer": "As a higher education student planning to stay in Portugal for more than 90 days, obtaining a residence permit is an essential step. Here's a straightforward guide to help you through the process:\n\n1. **If You Hold an EU Residence Permit**: If your current residence permit was issued by another European Union member state and you plan to stay longer than 90 days, you'll need to apply for a residence permit specific to higher education students with visa exemption under Article 91 of REPSAE as soon as you arrive in Portugal.\n\n2. **If You Hold a Third-Country Student Visa**: If your student visa was issued by a country outside the EU (known as a third-country), and you plan to stay beyond 90 days, you'll need to apply for a residence permit for higher education students upon arrival in Portugal.\n\n3. **Applying in Portugal**: For both cases, once in Portugal, you should gather necessary documents such as proof of acceptance at NOVA IMS or another Portuguese institution, evidence of sufficient financial resources to cover your stay, and any other supporting documents that might be required by the local authorities.\n\n4. **Professional Activity**: Once you have your residence permit for higher education students, you are allowed not only to study but also to engage in professional activities as a worker or self-employed individual, alongside your studies.\n\n5. **Duration of Stay**: As an EU resident, without a long-term visa, you can stay in Portugal for up to 90 days within any 180-day period. To extend this duration, obtaining the residence permit is necessary.\n\nTo ensure you have all the current requirements and process details, it’s advisable to consult with NOVA IMS or reach out directly to the Portuguese immigration services.
