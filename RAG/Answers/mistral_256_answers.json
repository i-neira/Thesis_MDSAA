This applies if you plan to stay in Portugal for more than 90 days. The process involves several steps, so it's important to be prepared and organized.\n\nFirst, check with the Portuguese embassy or consulate in your home country to find out if you need a visa to enter Portugal. If you do require a visa, make sure to apply for it before traveling. Once you're in Portugal, you can then apply for the Residence Permit.\n\nThe application process includes providing certain documents such as proof of enrollment at NOVA IMS, proof of sufficient funds for living expenses, and a valid health insurance policy. It's recommended to check the official Portuguese immigration website or contact the NOVA IMS international office for the most accurate and up-to-date information on required documentation and application procedures.\n\nThe process can take some time, so be prepared for potential delays. It's also essential to note that there may be a backlog in processing applications, so it's important to plan ahead and apply as soon as possible.\n\nRemember, moving abroad is an exciting new adventure!
