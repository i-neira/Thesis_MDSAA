        "question": "How can I prove my financial means to qualify for a residence permit?",
        "answer": " Absolutely, I'd be happy to help answer your question! To secure a residence permit in Portugal, you'll need to provide proof of your financial means. This could include several things depending on your specific situation. For instance, if you have a job offer, you might submit a copy of your employment contract or pay slips from the past three months. Alternatively, if you're self-employed or running a business, you would provide proof of your business activity and related receipts for the past six months. Other possibilities include student enrollment documents or proof of acceptance into a university program, along with evidence that you have enough resources to cover your tuition fees. If you're receiving a study or research grant, you can inform the consular post about this, which may exempt you from providing the financial means documentation. Remember, it's important to check with the appropriate authorities for the most accurate and up-to-date information. I hope this helps clarify things a bit! Let me know if you have any other questions related to NOVA IMS, studying in Portugal, or moving to Lisbon as an international student.",
