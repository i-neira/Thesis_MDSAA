        "answer": " After you've safely arrived in Lisbon, there are a few important steps you should take to ensure a smooth transition into your new life as a student. Here are some key actions:\n\n1. Register Your Residency: If you're an EU or EFTA national staying for longer than three months, it is mandatory to register your residency at your local council within the first 30 days. This process helps establish your legal standing in Portugal and will give you access to certain benefits and services.\n\n2. Obtain a Public Transport Subscription: Lisbon has an excellent public transportation system, making it the most convenient way to get around the city. You can choose between various subscription options based on your travel needs and budget. Keep in mind that if you're traveling extensively outside Lisbon, consider opting for a metropolitan subscription instead of a municipal one.\n\n3. Set Up Your Accommodation: Make sure your housing arrangements are in order. If you're living in student dormitories or apartments provided by NOVA IMS, familiarize yourself with the community rules and guidelines. Otherwise, ensure that you have a signed lease agreement and understand the payment terms and conditions of your accommodation provider.\n\n4. Explore Your New City: Lisbon offers an exciting mix of history, culture, and modern attractions. Spend some time discovering the best spots in the city, such as Belém Tower, Jerónimos Monastery, and LX Factory. Be sure to check out local markets like Feira da Ladra for authentic Portuguese experiences.\n\n5. Connect with Other Students: Joining student organizations or clubs related to your field of study is an excellent way to meet new friends and expand your network. NOVA IMS has a vibrant community, and many social events are organized throughout the year that you can attend to connect with like-minded individuals.\n\n6. Learn Basic Portuguese: Familiarizing yourself with basic Portuguese phrases will help you communicate effectively with locals and make daily life easier. While most Lisbon residents speak English, showing that you have made an effort to learn their language is appreciated and may even open new doors for you.\n\nThese steps will help you settle into your new environment more comfortably and set the foundation for a successful academic journey at NOVA IMS!

        "answer": " I'm glad you're asking about the process of obtaining a residence permit as a higher education student in Portugal. For students from European Union (EU) or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) nations, since you don't need a visa to study here, there's no formal application for a residence permit. However, if you plan to stay in Portugal for more than three months, you should apply for the CRUE Certificate of Residency at your local council within the first 30 days of your arrival.\n\nFor students from non-EU countries, the process is slightly different. You'll need a student visa to enter Portugal and begin your studies. Once you've been in Portugal for more than 90 days, or if your study program is longer than one year, you'll need to apply for a residence permit. This can be done upon arrival at the SEF (Serviços de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras) or AIMA (Instituto dos Alemantes, Imigracão e Fronteiras). The necessary documents include your passport, proof of acceptance into a Portuguese educational institution, and proof of financial resources to support yourself during your stay.\n\nIf you're already in Portugal with a temporary residence permit for higher education students or a residence visa for higher education students, you can extend your stay by applying for a renewal within 30 days before the expiration date.\n\nI hope this information helps clarify the process for you! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.",
