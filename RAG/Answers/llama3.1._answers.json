            "Alternatively, and part of the national immigration policies, Portuguese government created the “Português Lingua de Acolhimento” (PLA - Portuguese Host Language) programme, that seeks to provide foreign citizens with access to learning the Portuguese language, which is essential for their social, professional, and civic inclusion. The programme was developed to address migrants' needs, promoting social cohesion and preventing discrimination."

        "question": "As a higher education student, how can I obtain a residence permit in Portugal?",
        "answer": "As an international student at NOVA IMS, you'll need to apply for a residence permit in Portugal. Since you're a higher education student, you have several options.\n\nIf you're holding a residence permit issued by another European Union country, you can stay in Portugal for up to 90 days within any 180-day period. However, if you want to extend your stay beyond that, you'll need to apply for a residence permit for higher education students with visa exemption under no. 4 of article 91 of REPSAE.\n\nAlternatively, if you're a third-country national holding a Residence Visa for Higher Education Students, you can also apply for a residence permit in Portugal.\n\nTo obtain a residence permit, make sure you meet the general conditions and demonstrate that you have sufficient resources to attend your study program. You'll need to provide proof of admission to NOVA IMS or any other higher education institution in Portugal.\n\nI recommend checking the official government website or contacting NOVA IMS directly for more information on the application process and required documents. They can guide you through the steps and ensure you have everything you need to successfully apply for your residence permit.",
