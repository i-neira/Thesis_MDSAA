Master Degree in Risk Management

The Master's Degree Program in Risk Management prepares professionals and executives to address the challenges of identifying, assessing, and managing risk in the financial sector. Aligned with leading international standards such as those set by the CFA Institute and GARP, the program covers the essential knowledge needed for informed decision-making, in line with best practices and regulatory requirements (e.g., Basel III/IV and Solvency II).
With a current and innovative curriculum, the program takes a hands-on, practice-oriented approach, supported by a strong analytical foundation. It integrates cutting-edge techniques in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. It also explores the ongoing transformation of the financial industry driven by the adoption of technologies like blockchain and AI across FinTech, InsurTech, RegTech, Decentralized Finance, and Crypto-assets.
This program evolved from the Risk Analysis and Management specialization that was part of the Master’s in Statistics and Information Management – classified as the best Master's Degree in Risk Management in Portugal and the 2nd best in the world by Eduniversal (an international agency that publishes the annual ranking of the best Master's Degrees and MBAs in the world).
