Exceptional situations for foreign citizens
Specific situations in which certain documents cannot be submitted:

When the Agency for Integration, Migration and Asylum (AIMA, I.P.) requires the allocation of a Social Security Identification Number (NISS) by the Social Security Institute (ISS, I.P.) to the following persons, in order to grant them a residence permit so that they may carry out a professional activity:

- Foreign citizens with a visa for job search;
- Foreign citizens with a student visa;
- Citizens with a temporary stay visa (seasonal work);
- Among others.
 
In this type of situation, and when it is not possible to submit, for example, a residence permit/authorisation, or proof of the respective application submission, or even proof of the performance of a professional activity, the foreign citizen must attach the following documents to the NISS application form:

The applicable ID documents, as previously mentioned;
Statement/Request from AIMA, I.P. justifying the need for the NISS allocation to the foreign citizen.

The applicable ID documents, as previously mentioned;
Documents necessary for a Social Security benefit granting, according to the Social Security services of the area concerned.

 
When the application is submitted by a “frontier” worker, i.e., a person who works in Portugal but lives in another EU country, to which he/she returns every day or at least once a week, the residence permit/authorisation is not required (as the person concerned does not live in Portugal nor intends to live in Portugal). In this case, the foreign citizen must attach the following documents to the NISS application form:

The applicable ID documents, as previously mentioned;
Proof of employment (Employees, Domestic Service Workers) or self-employment (Self-employed Persons).

The NISS document may also be delivered to a Lawyer who submits his/her professional certificate and an original power of attorney.
It may also be collected by a third party, provided that he/she submits an original power of attorney or form PA 12 and the respective ID document.
The notification/communication of the NISS allocation, informing that the respective document must be collected at a Social Security Customer Information Service (with prior appointment), is sent to the applicant's address stated in the Application Form, or to the address of the Legal Representative, by Registered Letter.
