Postgraduate Program in Risk Management

The Postgraduate program in Risk Management prepares professionals and executives to address the challenges of identifying, assessing, and managing risk in the financial sector.
Aligned with leading international standards such as those set by the CFA Institute and GARP, the program covers the essential knowledge needed for informed decision-making, in line with best practices and regulatory requirements (e.g., Basel III/IV and Solvency II).
With a current and innovative curriculum, the program takes a hands-on, practice-oriented approach, supported by a strong analytical foundation. It integrates cutting-edge techniques in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. It also explores the ongoing transformation of the financial industry driven by the adoption of technologies like blockchain and AI across FinTech, InsurTech, RegTech, Decentralized Finance, and Crypto-assets.
This program evolved from the Postgraduate Program in Risk Analysis and Management, and gives access to the Master Degree Program in Risk Management, formerly the Master's Degree in Statistics and Information Management, with a specialisation in Risk Analysis and Management – classified as the best Master's Degree in Risk Management in Portugal and the 2nd best in the world by Eduniversal (an international agency that publishes the annual ranking of the best Master's Degrees and MBAs in the world).
