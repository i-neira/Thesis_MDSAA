Means of Subsistence
Ordinance no. 1563/2007, of December 11, establishes the means of subsistence that third-country nationals must have for entry and stay in Portugal.

Amount
The reference value is the guaranteed monthly minimum wage, that is, the national minimum wage. According to Decree-Law no. 107/2023, of November 17, the minimum wage set for 2024 is €820 (Article 273 of the Labor Code).

To apply for family reunification, the applicant’s household must have the following:
- First adult – 100% of the minimum wage
- Second or more adults – 50% of the minimum wage
- Children under 18 years old and dependent adult children – 30% of the minimum wage
For the purposes of family reunification, the required amount of means of subsistence is calculated based on the above percentages.
