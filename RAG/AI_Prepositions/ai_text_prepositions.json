If you need to move in a hurry and a nearby scooter or bike rental is the best option, it usually costs less than €5 per journey.\n\n\n\nAverage rent in Lisbon\n\nYour biggest living expense in Lisbon will certainly be the cost of your rent. The average cost of rent in Lisbon hit a peak during 2023, but has been decreasing ever since.
