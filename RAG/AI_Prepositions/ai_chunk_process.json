Foreign citizens and national citizens who are not required to have a Citizen Card must submit a request for a Social Security Identification Number (NISS). The request for a Social Security Identification Number (NISS) for these citizens is submitted via an online form called Pedido de NISS – Cidadão Estrangeiro ou Cidadão Nacional sem obrigatoriedade de ter cartão de cidadão. The Social Security Identification Number (NISS) for legal persons is automatically allocated when companies are created online. Legal persons registered at commercial registry offices trigger electronic and free-of-charge communication to the Social Security Institute. Legal persons' registration is mandatory and communicated to Social Security by the Tax and Customs Authority (AT). Legal persons' registration is communicated to Social Security during activity beginning communication. Legal persons' registration is communicated to Social Security during the creation of companies or associations under certain schemes. Legal persons' registration is communicated to Social Security during the admission of the first worker for natural persons employing others under employment contracts.

AIMA, I.P. may request NISS allocation for foreign citizens to grant them residence permits for professional activities. Foreign citizens in exceptional situations, such as those with job search visas, must attach a statement from AIMA, I.P. to the NISS application form.

The Geospatial Intelligence Certificate provides education and training in scientific concepts, methods, and key geospatial technologies. Key geospatial technologies are used in the solution of global problems of security and defense. Global problems of security and defense include emergency and civil protection, natural disasters, humanitarian crises, environmental risks, and military operations. Global problems of security and defense include political action in general, public health, education, transport, telecommunications, and management dilemmas of heritage. Global problems of security and defense include responding to economic, social, and cultural challenges. The main objective of the Geospatial Intelligence Certificate course is to train technicians capable of applying knowledge of image processing and remote sensing, geographic information science, informatics, and analytical tools to geospatial intelligence. Technicians trained in the course are capable of selecting, using, synthesizing, and demonstrating techniques, skills, and tools needed to solve GEOINT problems. GEOINT problems affect and stimulate society on a day-to-day basis. Students of the program are trained to apply and develop knowledge of image processing and remote sensing to geospatial intelligence. Students of the program are trained to apply and develop knowledge of geographic information science to geospatial intelligence. Students of the program are trained to apply and develop knowledge of computing and analytical processes to geospatial intelligence. Students are expected to investigate, collect, and interpret data leading to complex analyses. The program promotes a network unifying the National GEOINT Community (National GEOINT Network).
