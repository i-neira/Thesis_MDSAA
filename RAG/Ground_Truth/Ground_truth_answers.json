Once you've arrived, there are a few key administrative steps to get officially settled, and the process will depend on your nationality.\n\n**For students from EU/EFTA countries:**\nIf you plan to stay for more than three months, you must apply for a Certificate of Residency (CRUE). This should be done at your local Council within the 30 days following your first three months in Portugal.\n\n**For students from outside the EU/EFTA (Third-Country nationals):**\nIf you're staying for more than 90 days, you'll need to apply for a Residence Permit with the Agency for Integration, Migration, and Asylum (AIMA).\n\nFirst, check your residence visa very carefully—it often has a link to a pre-scheduled appointment. If not, you can check for an appointment or schedule one through the AIMA portal.\n\nFor the application, you'll generally need documents similar to those for your visa, such as your passport, proof of enrollment and paid tuition fees, proof of financial means, health insurance, and a criminal record check from your home country."
