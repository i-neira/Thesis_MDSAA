Once in Portugal and after the first three months, you will need to apply for the Certificado do Registo de Cidadão da União Europeia (CRUE Certificate of Residency) if you are an EU/EFTA student. For non-EU students, you will need to apply for a residence permit under the relevant articles in Law 23/2007.\n\n3. To apply for the residence permit, prepare the necessary documents such as your passport, proof of enrollment at the higher education institution, and financial resources. Depending on your nationality, you may also need to provide a criminal record certificate and pay any required fees.\n\n4. Submit your application in person at an AIMA (Portuguese Agency for Integration, Migration, and Asylum) location by appointment. Remember that the processing times can vary and it is recommended to apply as soon as possible.\n\n5.
