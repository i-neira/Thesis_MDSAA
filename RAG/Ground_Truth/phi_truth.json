Arriving as an international student can be both exciting and a bit overwhelming, but don’t worry—I’m here to help guide you through the first few important steps.\n\n1. **Register Your Residence**: As soon as you arrive, you’ll need to register your residence with local authorities. If you're from the EU or EEA, you'll apply for an European Union citizen registration certificate in Lisbon. This process typically involves visiting the local council office. It's a crucial step, so make sure to gather all necessary documents before heading there.\n\n2. **Apply for Your Portuguese Student VISA**: If you haven't already obtained your visa before arrival (which I highly recommend doing as soon as possible), be prepared to follow up on any requirements that might have been pending. Visa issues can take time, so getting this sorted early helps avoid unnecessary stress.\n\n3. **Set Up a Bank Account**: Opening a local bank account will make it easier to manage your finances, pay tuition fees, and handle everyday expenses. Most banks in Lisbon are welcoming to international students and offer accounts specifically for them.\n\n4. **Secure Housing**: If you haven’t found permanent accommodation yet, explore short-term options like hotels or hostels until you secure a longer-term rental. For rentals, it’s helpful to know that the average rent can vary significantly depending on your location and preferences in Lisbon.\n\n5. **Transportation**: Getting around Lisbon is easy with its excellent public transport system. Consider purchasing a Navegante card for monthly travel passes if you plan on using buses or trams frequently.\n\n6. **Explore Your New City**: Take some time to explore the neighborhoods around NOVA IMS, find local shops and markets, and maybe even join some student groups or activities that can help you settle in and make new friends.\n\nRemember, moving abroad is a big adventure!

        "ground_truth": "That's a very important question! To qualify for a residence permit, you need to prove you have sufficient financial means to support yourself. The reference amount is based on the Portuguese minimum wage, which is €820 per month for 2024.\n\nYou can prove this in several ways, depending on your situation. Common methods include:\n\n*   **Proof of employment:** An employment contract or a promise of one, along with recent pay slips.\n*   **Proof of freelance work:** A service provision contract, business activity registration, or proof of services provided.\n*   **Remote work:** An employment contract or a declaration from your employer, even if they are outside Portugal.\n*   **Scholarships or grants:** A declaration from the institution awarding you a research or scientific grant.\n*   **Financial resources:** A document showing you have sufficient funds available in a Portuguese financial institution.\n*   **Other income:** Proof of retirement income or income from financial investments.\n\nIt's also good to know that some students are exempt from this requirement. For example, students admitted to certain approved institutions or those receiving a scholarship from Instituto Camões may not need to provide proof of financial means."
